I have used the company logo and branding colour scheme throughout the site and utilised Google’s “Eye Dropper” extension to pick out the colours from the company logo.

Where appropriate transparent background effects were used while still using the branding colours.

**Colour list:**

**Typography**

Although I imported Google Fonts I have mainly used Arial and increased the letter spacing on white text and purple backgrounds in the Hero images. ref Code Institute “Love Running” tutorial site

@import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Merienda+One|Open+Sans&display=swap");
