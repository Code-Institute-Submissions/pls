*Please note the limitations of this site as an assignment project are unable to fully reflect the actual requirements of a business site*

## Structure

**The site will consist of:**

 - A Home page displaying an overview of products and services offered
   by the business to current and potential customers.
 - A Hire products page displaying images and descriptions of the types
   of equipment available for hire.
 - A Contact page containing an enquiry form for users to contact PLS.

**Design**

I have used the company logo and branding colour scheme throughout the site and utilised Google’s “Eye Dropper” extension to pick out the colours from the company logo.

Where appropriate transparent background effects were used while still using the branding colours.

**Colour list:**

`#562680``#528``darkslateblue``hsl(272,54%,32%)``rgb(86,38,128)`

`#f8f9fa``#fff``ghostwhite``hsl(210,16%,97%)``rgb(248,249,250)`


**Typography**

Although I imported Google Fonts I have mainly used Arial and increased the letter spacing on white text and purple backgrounds in the Hero images. *ref Code Institute “Love Running” tutorial site*

@import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Merienda+One|Open+Sans&display=swap");


**Call to Action**

- The Bootstrap Navbar text links were increased to h4 to give more emphasis on larger screen sizes and reduced via CSS for mobile devices.
To aid navigation the text for the links in the Navbar are coloured Black when on target, with all other links in the Navbar coloured Red.

- A link to a **Popup** displaying the Hire terms is included in the Hire information block below the Hero image.

- Contact/Enquiries form on the contact page encourages the user to engage with PLS.

- Google map in all footers displays the company location and includes all the functionality expected from a Google embedded map.

### Images

 - All images are either the property of the company or provided by
   equipment suppliers.
**Images used:**

## Site Framework

**Responsive layout**

 - The responsive design of the site retains the style and branding as the screen size changes.
 - I used the Bootstrap 5 Branded Navbar for the site navigation in the
   header and a Bootstrap Grid for hire equipment images.

## Testing

**Navigaation**

 - All links have been tested.
 - The PLS logo returns the user back to the Home page.
 - To aid navigation the text for the links in the Navbar are coloured
   black when on target, with all other links in the Navbar coloured
   red.

**Responsiveness**

The responsive ranges targeted were:

 - For Desktops @media screen max-width 5000px  
 - For Handheld Touchscreens with screen max-width: 1280px
 - Mobile phones with screen max-width: 414px
 
**Responsiveness Testing**

- Testing was initially carried using the Chrome Developer Tools using the responsive ranges listed above. Further developer tool testing was carried out using the Firefox and Microsoft Edge developer tools.

- The Firefox tools did find an issue with the iPhone 6/7/8 Plus iOS11 screen size which was resolved by increasing the max width to 414px.

- Hardware tested ranged from a Motorola G5s, Samsung Galaxy S5, 10" Amazon Kindle Fire Tablet and a widescreen desktop PC.

**Browser Testing**
Browsers used for testing were:

 - Google Chrome - Desktop and Mobile
 - Firefox - Desktop and Mobile
 - Microsoft Edge
 - Amazon Silk

**Performance Testing**
Performance tested against Google Lighthouse Developer Tools which were very useful for testing and as an aid to increase performance with it suggested improvements.
An initial example of poor performance was the Contact page with the following stats:


![Poor Contact Performence](https://starranuk.github.io/pls/assets/readme_files/contact_performence_low.png) 


By altering background contrasts, font colours and improving the Metafile content the following was achieved:

## User Testing
### Testing - What a user may expect

 
 **Easy and intuitive website navigation.**

 - On entering the site the user immediately see's the navigation bar
   and the easily readable links at the top of the page

 **That all links within the PLS site work.**

   business.**
 

 - On entering the site the user is greeted with the company logo and
   the Hero image which shows one of the liveried company vehicles
   outside the company premises. This shows that the company is
   established.    
  

 - The Hero image slowly zooms in drawing the users eye    to the text 
   over the image, the company name and below that    "Supplying
   Everything Below The Hook" which quickly establishes the    purpose
   of the company to any one familiar with the Lifting Industry.

   vehicle in the hero image.

Initially some errors were picked up by the Validator, these ranged from Elements with no closing tags, elements such as iframe which required a title to double ups on alt attributes. However, as the Validator tells you what thee error is and on what line code is easily resolved.
The following images are the pass results for all three pages:

**Home Page**
