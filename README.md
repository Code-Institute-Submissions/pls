## Structure

**The site will consist of:**

   by the business to current and potential customers.
 - A Hire products page displaying images and descriptions of the types
   of hire equipment available for hire.
 - A Contact page containing a form for users to contact and make
   enquiries with PLS.

**Design**

I have used the company logo and branding colour scheme throughout the site and utilised Google’s “Eye Dropper” extension to pick out the colours from the company logo.

Where appropriate transparent background effects were used while still using the branding colours.

**Colour list:**
rgba(51, 45, 108, .7);
`#562680``#528``darkslateblue``hsl(272,54%,32%)``rgb(86,38,128)`

`#f8f9fa``#fff``ghostwhite``hsl(210,16%,97%)``rgb(248,249,250)`
**Typography**

Although I imported Google Fonts I have mainly used Arial and increased the letter spacing on white text and purple backgrounds in the Hero images. *ref Code Institute “Love Running” tutorial site*

@import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Merienda+One|Open+Sans&display=swap");

**Call to Action**

The Bootstrap Navbar text links were increased to h4 to give more emphasis on larger screen sizes and reduced via CSS for small devices.

A link to a popup display

Contact/Enquiries form on the contact page.

Google map in all footers displaying the companies location and includes all the functionality expected from a Google map.

**Images**

All images are either the property of the company or provided by equipment suppliers.

**List images**

**Site Framework**

## Responsive layout

The sites responsive design retains the style and branding of the site as screen size change.

I used the Bootstrap Branded Navbar for the site navigation in the header and a Boostrap Grid for hire equipment images.

## Testing

**Navigaation**

 - All links have been tested.
 - The PLS logo returns the user back to the Home page.
 - To aid navigation the text for the links in the Navbar are coloured
   black when on target, with all other links in the Navbar coloured
   red.

**Responsiveness**

The responsive ranges I targeted were:

 - For Desktops @media screen max-width 5000px  
 - For Handheld Touchscreens with screen max-width: 1280px
 - Mobile phones with screen max-width: 414px
 - 
**Responsiveness Testing**

Testing was initially carried using the Chrome Developer Tools using the responsive ranges listed above. Further developer tool testing was carried out using the Firefox and Microsoft Edge developer tools.

The Firefox tools did find an issue with the iPhone 6/7/8 Plus iOS11 screen size which was resolved by increasing the max width to414px.

Hardware tested ranged from a Motorola G5s, Samsung Galaxy S5, 10" Amazon Kindle Fire Tablet and a widescreen desktop PC.

**Browser Testing**
Browsers used for testing were:

 - Google Chrome - Desktop and Mobile
 - Firefox - Desktop and Mobile
 - Microsoft Edge
 - Amazon Silk



**Performance Testing**
Performance tested against Google Lighthouse Developer Tools which were very useful for testing and as an aid to increase performance with it suggested improvements.
An initial example of poor performance was the Contact page with the following stats:

![Poor Contact Performence](https://starranuk.github.io/pls/assets/readme_files/contact_performence_low.png) 

By altering background contrasts, font colours and improving the Metafile content the following was achieved:
